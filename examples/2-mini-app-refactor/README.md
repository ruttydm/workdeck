# 2-mini-app-refactor

A realistic multi-file demo where a tiny morning-summary app gets reorganized into grouped output.

## Run

```bash
workdeck patch examples/2-mini-app-refactor/change.patch
```

## What to look for

- a multi-file review stream in sidebar order
- a new helper module added mid-change
- the entrypoint switching from flat output to grouped sections
- a matching Rust test update at the end of the review

Both trees and the translated patch are exercised by `cargo test -p workdeck-examples`.
