Use `diff` for working-copy or comparison input and `show` for one committed change.

## Review the working tree

```bash
workdeck diff
```

For Git and Sapling working-copy reviews, Workdeck includes untracked or unknown files by default. Exclude them explicitly:

```bash
workdeck diff --exclude-untracked
```

Review only staged Git changes with either spelling:

```bash
workdeck diff --staged
workdeck diff --cached
```

## Compare against a target

```bash
workdeck diff main
workdeck diff main...feature -- src/core
```

Arguments after `--` are pathspecs. Before `--`, the target is interpreted by the detected VCS.

## Review a commit

```bash
workdeck show
workdeck show HEAD~2 -- README.md src/ui
```

`show` defaults to the latest commit. The loaded files still form one review stream, so path filtering changes the input rather than changing navigation behavior.

## Review a stash

Git repositories can open a stash directly:

```bash
workdeck stash show
workdeck stash show stash@{2}
```

Staging areas and stashes are Git-only. Workdeck reports a focused error if these operations are requested under a VCS that does not support them.
