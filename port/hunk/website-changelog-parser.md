# Website changelog parser continuation

`cargo xtask changelog parse <markdown-file>` reads a changelog and prints parsed
release JSON without writing repository state. The new parser translates the
release-ordering, Changesets bullet cleanup, fenced heading/bullet handling,
legacy dates, highlights and empty-section filtering from pinned Hunk's
MIT-licensed `scripts/generate-changelog.ts`. Existing fragment commands remain
unchanged.

An executed differential comparison imported `parseChangelog` from disposable
checkouts of both pinned baselines using Bun 1.3.14. It compared the parsed JSON
values against the native command reading each original `CHANGELOG.md`:
all 48 main releases and all 47 stable releases matched. This compares complete
release values, not only counts. These live comparisons are not yet committed
frozen oracle fixtures and do not claim complete input-domain parity.

Native tests cover legacy dates, linked and bare-SHA entries, prerelease order,
highlights, empty sections, fenced headings and delimiter matching, and exact
version headings. Version digits are explicitly ASCII, matching JavaScript's
source regex rather than Rust regex's Unicode digit class.

This is only the parser portion. Full comparator edge cases, the complete source
test corpus, release grouping and overlays, date resolution, generated pages,
feeds, cards, cleanup safety and all output/check orchestration remain open.
No source interval or source file is marked complete by this change.
