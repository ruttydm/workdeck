# Large-stream performance investigation

These reports expose an outstanding release-gate failure. They are **not** parity certification.

On 2026-09-07 UTC (2026-09-08 local), three subprocess samples per implementation ran sequentially
on the same Apple M1 Pro, macOS 26.5.2 arm64 host after compilation and test jobs had finished.
Workdeck used Rust 1.95.0 (`59807616e`, 2026-04-14) and the
default optimized Cargo release profile at `28a8854a49e4acabc9c27a03a02dc69f3857680c`.
Both disposable Hunk checkouts used Bun 1.3.14 with update notices and MCP disabled.
Other host activity was not controlled; no peak-memory comparison was captured.

| Median, milliseconds | Hunk main 2c00f435 | Hunk v0.20.1 | Workdeck 28a8854a |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Cold first frame | 2.40 | 2.08 | 237.62 |
| Warm first frame | 1.76 | 1.56 | 235.13 |
| Four wheel ticks | 197.42 | 207.60 | 1815.55 |

All three native timings exceed the 10% limit against both pins. The report schema's inherited
15%-plus-absolute thresholds are historical compatibility metadata, not Workdeck's acceptance gate.
All reports agree on 180 files, 120 lines per file and four scroll ticks.

The source workload excludes fixture/app construction and highlight-settlement cleanup from its
timers. Therefore first-frame results are not full-process launch results. A separate debug CPU
sample caught `ReviewApp::new` → cursor seeding → review-row construction → highlighting;
that observation does not quantify optimized startup cost or establish a complete profile.

Reproduce the native report from its recorded commit:

```console
cargo build --release -p xtask
target/release/xtask benchmark run --script large-stream.ts --samples 3 --out REPORT.json
```

For each pinned disposable oracle checkout, execute the original benchmark runner with Bun 1.3.14:

```console
HUNK_MCP_DISABLE=1 HUNK_DISABLE_UPDATE_NOTICE=1 bun benchmarks/run.ts --script large-stream.ts --samples 3 --out REPORT.json
```

The Bun command is oracle-only, never a Workdeck runtime/tooling dependency or installation path.
Raw reports retain every sample, source Git SHA, runtime identity, quantile and structural metric:

- [Pinned main](large-stream-hunk-2c00f435.json)
- [Pinned stable](large-stream-hunk-v0.20.1.json)
- [Optimized native before performance fixes](large-stream-native-28a8854a.json)
